# Starbucks Event App

A single page application that helps Starbucks employees navigate the bi-annual Starbucks Innovation Expo event, an internal tech conference that regularly gets 1,000+ attendees

## Getting Started

Visit [https://ramirs.github.io/event-app/](https://ramirs.github.io/event-app/) to see the app in action, or clone the repo and spin it up yourself!

### Running Locally

Cloning is simple, but requires you to spin up your own server. This event app isn't built with a standard CLI to keep the codebase lightweight and clean.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ramirs/event-app/
```

In order to spin up the app, I recommend using a service like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) ...
```
$ http-server event-app/
```

## Built With

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Lightweight SPA framework
* [Localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - DOM API
